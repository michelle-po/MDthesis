# Qualitative Interviews

## Goal description

With this interview, I aim to find some insights that won't come off working individually on my desktop. I want to explore the difference in the digital relationship between digital natives and digital immigrants. The only problem will be to ask the rights questions. Some (old) people will not have a real consumption of a computer, so I need to ask for a POV and an opinion that could allow them to answer.

## Sampling

WHO: DI and DN, different jobs and degrees (add description)
WHEN: 20 may-31 may
WHERE: Vaud/Ticino

## Questions

- Are you a computer owner? / There is a computer in your house?
- When and on which device was your first approach to a computer? How old were you? How do you feel?
- Was it your initiative in your private life or due to a need at your school/work? Were you helped by someone/lessons?
- Was it hard to understand how it works?
- Do you think it helped in your daily tasks?
- There is a physical action in your life that it's now totally replaced with a digital option?
- What is your daily consumption of computers now? (Is it part of your life? What do you use it for? You ask someone to do it for you?)
- Do you have a special relationship/story with your actual device? How did you choose/buy it?
- What's for you the problem with your computer? Are you able to troubleshoot?
- How do you feel about new technologies?
